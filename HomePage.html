        <p><h5>Hello there! My name is John, and I love music. On this site I'll be talking about some
              of my favorite albums and artists, and even doing some reviews. Here's a little bit about me and
              how I came to love music: Around the time that I was 9 or 10, I discovered the itunes store, on which
              I would spend hours exploring and making lists of songs that I wanted. At this point, I didn't stray
              far out of the realm of pop music. Then, I discovered Coldplay, a band that bridges pop styles with rock
              electronic, and many other genres. Coldplay was my gateway into the wider musical universe, putting me
              on the path to some of my favorite artists and eclectic musical tastes. Currently, I listen to just about everything,
              including: rock to pop, indie, grunge, shoegaze, post-punk, IDM, rap, ambient, alternative, synth pop, electronic,
              lo-fi, industrial rap, jazz, plunderphonics, new wave, glam rock, trance, classical, modern clasical,
              hip-hop, trip-hop, noise rock, punk, or folk, and everything in between (except for country, but Wilco might be
              changing my mind).
            <br/>
            <br/>
              My love of listening to music (as well as a certain chain of events involving a head injury, long story)
              has also led me to begin playing instruments, including the piano, guitar, synthesizer, and bass, which  has
              become my passion.
            <br/>
            <br/>
              Sadly, though, I don't really know anyone who likes the music I do. I created this site so that I can express
              my opinions and share my love of music with others!
